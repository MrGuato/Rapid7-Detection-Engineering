Detection Explanation:
Detects File Zipping: This part of the query looks for events where the command line contains "7z.exe" and "a" to identify the use of 7-Zip to archive files.

Public Sending Detection: This part of the query looks for events where the destination address matches a public address.

Purpose of Protection:
Prevent Unauthorized File Exfiltration: The query aims to detect potential unauthorized exfiltration of files by identifying when files are zipped using 7-Zip and sent to a public address. By monitoring such actions, organizations can take immediate steps to investigate and mitigate any potential data breaches.

This Query Does the Following:
Detects Password Changes: It looks for events where "net.exe" is used to change a password to a random 32-character string.

Detects Process Termination: It looks for events where "winlogon.exe" is terminated, which could prevent logins and indicate malicious activity.

Both queries are designed to spot potentially malicious or suspicious activities and provide early warnings to protect the organization's security.
