This repository is dedicated to enhancing security monitoring and threat detection by providing a comprehensive collection of detection rules and methodologies. Our goal is to empower the security community with actionable, well-crafted detections to identify and mitigate threats effectively.

🔍 Detections:
Our detections are categorized based on the threats they address. Currently, we have XX detection rules, all available in the detections directory.

Categories include:
✅ Malware Detection – Identify malicious software and indicators of compromise (IOCs)
✅ Phishing Detection – Spot email-based threats, social engineering attempts, and credential harvesting
✅ Intrusion Detection – Detect unauthorized access and exploitation attempts
✅ Anomaly Detection – Flag unusual activities and deviations from baseline behavior
✅ Behavioral Analysis – Uncover suspicious patterns and attacker tactics

🛠 Contributions: Before submitting a detection rule, please ensure it is well-documented and thoroughly tested to maintain high-quality standards.
